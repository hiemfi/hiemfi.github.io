        <h2>The trouble with Bears</h2>
        <p><strong>By Evan Wild</strong></p>
        <p>
          Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud, independent creatures, self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing like the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from renowned documentary, <em>The Jungle Book</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such a skewed vision? In this article we try to answer those questions, and give you a real insight into the life of the bear.
        </p>

        <h3>Types of bear</h3>
        <p>
          Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you have seen a small bear, then it was in fact probably a baby bear (cub) from another species.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bears can also be classified in terms of their habitat — both large and medium bears are just as at home in urban areas as they are in the countryside. Different habitats encourage different behaviour however, as you'll find out below.
        </p>

        <table>
          <caption>Bear Types and Traits</caption>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th scope="col">Bear Type</th>

              <td>25 to 28 years</td>
              <td>Fish, meat, plants</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th scope="row">Urban</th>
              <td>North Face</td>
              <td>18 to 22</td>
              <td>Condos and coffee shops</td>
              <td>20 to 32 years</td>
              <td>Starbucks, sushi</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <h3>Habitats and Eating habits</h3>
        <p>
          Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other naturally growing ingredients. They will hunt in woodland or rivers, but may also raid farms or country houses.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          Urban bears have adapted to the city. They scavenge in dumpsters and sometimes break into kitchens. When desperate, they hunt urban pests like rats and foxes.
        </p>

        <p>
          These bears sleep in parks, public restrooms, or apartments.
        </p>

        <h3>Mating rituals</h3>
        <p>
          Bears are romantic creatures by nature, and will naturally look for a mate they can spend their life with. Wild bears use cave art and reeds to woo mates. Urban bears prefer mood lighting and Bublé.

                <p>Oh I am so glad you taught me all about the big brown angry guys in the woods. With their sniffing little noses and their bad attitudes, they can sure be a menace — I was thinking of putting them all in a truck and driving them outta here. I run a zoo, you know.</p>
